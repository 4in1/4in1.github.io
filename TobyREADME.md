Good to see you at Drew's party. Here's what we talked about.

- Make a general github account with your name or use ur tweetthedebates account, then add yourself to the 4in1 "organization". (GitHub has 2 membership levels: individual & organizations made up of individuals.) Other members can be added or add themselves because of the way I set it up (public membership instead of private).
- Get familiar with [markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics), which is the syntax for writing on the web that GitHub's internal tools use. It's simple, and exists to prioritize writing versus writing with markup language all wrapped around text (like html). Your markdown files will automatically be compiled into html when you go to publish. This .md file I'm writing now is written in markdown. You can look at the raw file of it here in GitHub to see.
- I published the 4in1 using [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages). That means that there are at least two views of the 4in1 repository:
    + the rendered page found at [4in1.github.io](http://4in1.github.io), and
    + the code found at [github.com/4in1](http://github.com/4in1)
